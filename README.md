# Environmental Justice Water Chemical Contamination

This repository includes the information of an environmental justice study about Chemical Drinking Water Contamination in Arizona.


# Objective of the study
The objective of this research is to estimate an econometric model to find the most relevant socio-economic characteristics of the population affected by chemical water contamination in drinking water on Arizona, considering violations for arsenic, lead, and copper.  Thus, this study seeks to establish a significant difference between the affected a non-affected populace and identify inequalities in population with certain characteristics
